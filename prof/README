callgrind.out.s??-inv        original version, inverting a full rank covariance matrix
callgrind.out.s??-eigs       low rank assumption using k eigenvecs of cov. matrix (step 2)
callgrind.out.s??-eigs-12    low rank assumption using k eigenvecs of cov. matrix (step 1 & 2)
callgrind.out.s??-idsvd      low rank assumption using k sing. vecs. of data matrix (step 1)
callgrind.out.s??-idsvd-12   low rank assumption using k sing. vecs. of data matrix (step 1 & 2)

PROFILING ANALYSIS
==================

inv vs eigs
-----------

(1) Reduction factors for Bayesian estimate in the second step 

	Reduction in cov matrix decomposition			: 0.9231
	Reduction in matrix product for group denoising		: 0.0605
	Overall reduction in step 2 bayes estimate		: 0.6143

(2) Figures in (1) are the same regardless of the noise level.

(3) For higher noise levels, the number of patch groups processed increases
    in both the first and second step:

				| s10	| s20	| s40
	groups in step 1	| 14194	| 15757	| 17012
	groups in step 2	| 24481	| 24778	| 31426

(4) Figures in (3) are the same for both low rank and full rank implementations
