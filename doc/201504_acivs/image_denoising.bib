	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for Bayesian denoising of magnetic resonance (MR) images that bootstraps itself by inferring the prior, i.e., the uncorrupted-image statistics, from the corrupted input data and the knowledge of the Rician noise model. The proposed method relies on principles from empirical Bayes (EB) estimation. It models the prior in a nonparametric Markov random field (MRF) framework and estimates this prior by optimizing an information-theoretic metric using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The generality and power of nonparametric modeling, coupled with the EB approach for prior estimation, avoids imposing ill-fitting prior models for denoising. The results demonstrate that, unlike typical denoising methods, the proposed method preserves most of the important features in brain MR images. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel Bayesian-inference algorithm on MRFs, namely iterated conditional entropy reduction (ICER). This paper also extends the application of the proposed method for denoising diffusion-weighted MR images. Validation results and quantitative comparisons with the state of the art in MR-image denoising clearly depict the advantages of the proposed method.},

Insights from that study are used here to derive a high-performance practical denoising algorithm. We propose a patch-based Wiener filter that exploits patch redundancy for image denoising. Our framework uses both geometrically and photometrically similar patches to estimate the different filter parameters. We describe how these parameters can be accurately estimated directly from the input noisy image. Our denoising approach, designed for near-optimal performance (in the mean-squared error sense), has a sound statistical foundation that is analyzed in detail. The performance of our approach is experimentally verified on a variety of images and noise levels. The results presented here demonstrate that our proposed method is on par or exceeding the current state of the art, both visually and quantitatively.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach to still image denoising based on effective filtering in 3D transform domain by combining sliding-window transform processing with block-matching. We process blocks within the image in a sliding manner and utilize the block-matching concept by searching for blocks which are similar to the currently processed one. The matched blocks are stacked together to form a 3D array and due to the similarity between them, the data in the array exhibit high level of correlation. We exploit this correlation by applying a 3D decorrelating unitary transform and effectively attenuate the noise by shrinkage of the transform coecients. The subsequent inverse 3D transform yields estimates of all matched blocks. After repeating this procedure for all image blocks in sliding manner, the final estimate is computed as weighed average of all overlapping block- estimates. A fast and ecient algorithm implementing the proposed approach is developed. The experimental results show that the proposed method delivers state-of-art denoising performance, both in terms of objective criteria and visual quality.},

In this paper we construct analysis and synthesis frames, formalizing the BM3D image modeling and use these frames to develop novel iterative deblurring algorithms. We consider two different formulations of the deblurring problem: one given by minimization of the single objective function and another based on the Nash equilibrium balance of two objective functions. The latter results in an algorithm where the denoising and deblurring operations are decoupled. The convergence of the developed algorithms is proved. Simulation experiments show that the decoupled algorithm derived from the Nash equilibrium formulation demonstrates the best numerical and visual results and shows superiority with respect to the state of the art in the field, confirming a valuable potential of BM3D-frames as an advanced image modeling tool.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the restoration of images with signal-dependent noise. The filter is noise smoothing and adapts to local changes in image statistics based on a nonstationary mean, nonstationary variance (NMNV) image model. For images degraded by a class of uncorrelated, signal-dependent noise without blur, the adaptive noise smoothing filter becomes a point processor and is similar to Lee's local statistics algorithm [16]. The filter is able to adapt itself to the nonstationary local image statistics in the presence of different types of signal-dependent noise. For multiplicative noise, the adaptive noise smoothing filter is a systematic derivation of Lee's algorithm with some extensions that allow different estimators for the local image variance. The advantage of the derivation is its easy extension to deal with various types of signal-dependent noise. Film-grain and Poisson signal-dependent restoration problems are also considered as examples. All the nonstationary image statistical parameters needed for the filter can be estimated from the noisy image and no a priori information about the original image is required.},

	abstract = {Nonlocal image \ldots lters suppress noise and other distortions by searching for similar patches at di¤erent locations within the image, thus exploiting the self-similarity present in natural images. This similarity is typically assessed by a windowed distance of the patches pixels. Inspired by the human visual system, we introduce a patch foveation operator and measure patch similarity through a foveated distance, where each patch is blurred with spatially variant point-spread functions having standard deviation increasing with the spatial distance from the patch center. In this way, we install a di¤erent form of self-similarity in images: the foveated self-similarity. We consider the Nonlocal Means algorithm (NL-means) for the removal of additive white Gaussian noise as a simple prototype of nonlocal image \ldots ltering and derive an explicit construction of its corresponding foveation operator, thus yielding the Foveated NL-means algorithm. Our analysis and experimental study show that, to the purpose of image denoising, the foveated self-similarity can be a far more e¤ective regularity assumption than the conventional windowed self-similarity. In the comparison with NL-means, the proposed foveated algorithm achieves a substantial improvement in denoising quality, according to both objective criteria and visual appearance, particularly due to better contrast and sharpness. Moreover, foveation is introduced at a negligible cost in terms of computational complexity.},

	abstract = {A discrete denoising algorithm estimates the input sequence to a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) based on the observation of the entire output sequence. For the case in which the DMC is known and the quality of the reconstruction is evaluated with a given single-letter fidelity criterion, we propose a discrete denoising algorithm that does not assume knowledge of statistical properties of the input sequence. Yet, the algorithm is universal in the sense of asymptotically performing as well as the optimum denoiser that knows the input sequence distribution, which is only assumed to be stationary. Moreover, the algorithm is universal also in a semi-stochastic setting, in which the input is an individual sequence, and the randomness is due solely to the channel noise. The proposed denoising algorithm is practical, requiring a linear number of register-level operations and sublinear working storage size relative to the input data length.},
