The spatial-domain denoising technique is a selective wavelet shrinkage method which uses a two-threshold criteria to exploit the geometry of the wavelet subbands of each video frame, and each frame of the image sequence is spatially denoised independently of one another. The temporal-domain denoising technique is a selective wavelet shrinkage method which estimates the level of noise corruption as well as the amount of motion in the image sequence. The amount of noise is estimated to determine how much filtering is needed in the temporal-domain, and the amount of motion is taken into consideration to determine the degree of similarity between consecutive frames. The similarity affects how much noise removal is possible using temporal-domain processing. Using motion and noise level estimates, a video denoising technique is established which is robust to various levels of noise corruption and various levels of motion.},

	abstract = {Here, we present an efficient method for movie denoising that does not require any motion estimation. The method is based on the well-known fact that averaging several realizations of a random variable reduces the variance. For each pixel to be denoised, we look for close similar samples along the level surface passing through it. With these similar samples, we estimate the denoised pixel. The method to find close similar samples is done via warping lines in spatiotemporal neighborhoods. For that end, we present an algorithm based on a method for epipolar line matching in stereo pairs which has per-line complexity O (N), where N is the number of columns in the image. In this way, when applied to the image sequence, our algorithm is computationally efficient, having a complexity of the order of the total number of pixels. Furthermore, we show that the presented method is unsupervised and is adapted to denoise image sequences with an additive white noise while respecting the visual details on the movie frames. We have also experimented with other types of noise with satisfactory results.},

Current motion-compensated spatio-temporal noise filters treat the estimation of the DVF as a preprocessing step. Generally, no attemp is made to verfy the accuracy of these estimates prior to their use in the filter. By simultaneously estimating these two fields, we establish a link betwee the two estimators. It is through this link that the DVF estimate and its corresponding accuracy information are shared with the other intensity estimator, and vice versa. To model the DVF and the intensity field, we use coupled Gauss-Markov (CGM) models. A CGM model consists of two levels: an upper level, which is made up of several submodels with various characteristics, and a lower level or line field, which governs the transitions between submodels. The CGM models are well suited for estimating the displacement and intensity fields since the resulting estimates preserve the boundaries between the stationary areas present in both fields. Detailed line fileds are proposed for the modeling of these boundaries, which also take into account the correlations that exist between these two fields. A Kalman-type estimator results, followed by a decision criterion for choosing the appropriate set of line fields. Several experiments using noisy and noisy-blurred image sequences demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with respect to prediction error and mean-squared error.},

	abstract = {Neighborhood filters are nonlocal image and movie filters which reduce the noise by averaging similar pixels. The first object of the paper is to present a unified theory of these filters and reliable criteria to compare them to other filter classes. A CCD noise model will be presented justifying the involvement of neighborhood filters. A classification of neighborhood filters will be proposed, including classical image and movie denoising methods and discussing further a recently introduced neighborhood filter, NL-means. In order to compare denoising methods three principles will be discussed. The first principle, "method noise", specifies that only noise must be removed from an image. A second principle will be introduced, "noise to noise", according to which a denoising method must transform a white noise into a white noise. Contrarily to "method noise", this principle, which characterizes artifact-free methods, eliminates any subjectivity and can be checked by mathematical arguments and Fourier analysis. "Noise to noise" will be proven to rule out most denoising methods, with the exception of neighborhood filters. This is why a third and new comparison principle, the "statistical optimality", is needed and will be introduced to compare the performance of all neighborhood filters. The three principles will be applied to compare ten different image and movie denoising methods. It will be first shown that only wavelet thresholding methods and NL-means give an acceptable method noise. Second, that neighborhood filters are the only ones to satisfy the "noise to noise" principle. Third, that among them NL-means is closest to statistical optimality. A particular attention will be paid to the application of the statistical optimality criterion for movie denoising methods. It will be pointed out that current movie denoising methods are motion compensated neighborhood filters. This amounts to say that they are neighborhood filters and that the ideal neighborhood of a pixel is its trajectory. Unfortunately the aperture problem makes it impossible to estimate ground true trajectories. It will be demonstrated that computing trajectories and restricting the neighborhood to them is harmful for denoising purposes and that space-time NL-means preserves more movie details.},

Two main issues are addressed in this paper, namely, the estimation of noise model and the proper use of motion estimation in the denoising process. Unlike previous algorithms which estimate the level of noise, our method learns the full noise distribution nonparametrically which serves as the likelihood model in the MRF. Instead of using deterministic motion estimation to align pixels, we set up a temporal likelihood by combining a probabilistic motion field with the learned noise model. The prior of this MRF is modeled by piece-wise smoothness. The main advantage of the proposed spatio-temporal MRF is that it integrates spatial and temporal information adaptively into a statistical inference framework, where the posteriori is optimized using graph cuts with alpha expansion. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on benchmark data sets and real videos to show the advantages of our algorithm compared with previous single frame and multi-frame algorithms.},

	abstract = {We propose an e¤ective video denoising method based on highly sparse signal representation in local 3D transform domain. A noisy video is processed in blockwise manner and for each processed block we form a 3D data array that we call “group” by stacking together blocks found similar to the currently processed one. This grouping is realized as a spatio-temporal predictive-search block-matching, similar to techniques used for motion estimation. Each formed 3D group is filtered by a 3D transform-domain shrink- age (hard-thresholding and Wiener filtering), the result of which are estimates of all grouped blocks. This filtering— that we term “collaborative filtering”— exploits the correla- tion between grouped blocks and the corresponding highly sparse representation of the true signal in the transform domain. Since, in general, the obtained block estimates are mutually overlapping, we aggregate them by a weighted aver- age in order to form a non-redundant estimate of the video. Significant improvement of this approach is achieved by using a two-step algorithm where an intermediate estimate is produced by grouping and collaborative hard-thresholding and then used both for improving the grouping and for applying collaborative empirical Wiener filtering. We develop an efficient realization of this video denoising algorithm. The experimental results show that at reasonable computational cost it achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.},

The temporal correlation of adjacent frames is often completely determined by the displacement field, which over the course of time traces out the motion trajectories of moving objects within the scene. It is possible to exploit the available redundancy in these signals for the purpose of noise reduction by compensating for the presence of motion. We present an adaptive filtering technique which implicitly compensates for motion within a scene by performing 1-D signal estimation along a set of hypothesized motion directions. This technique adapts the estimator parameters to the local image characteristics along a set of specified directions in the 3-D signal space. Experiments with real life scenes have shown that this method achieves substantial noise reduction in many cases, while preserving the edge contrast of the desired signal.},

In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel motion-field filtering step that refines the accuracy of the motion estimates to a degree that is required for denoising.

For the estimation, a recursive block-matcher is used with a match criterion based on higher order statistics. By weighing out outlier data, this estimator provides robust estimates.

This method combines the use of motion compensation and signal decomposition to account for the effects of object motion. Because of object motion, image sequences are temporally nonstationary, which requires the use of adaptive filters. By motion compensating the sequence prior to filtering, nonstationarities, i.e., parts of the signal that are momentarily not stationary, can be reduced significantly. However, since not all nonstationarities can be accounted for by motion, a motion-compensated signal still contains nonstationarities. An adaptive algorithm based on order statistics is described that decomposes the motion-compensated signal into a noise-free nonstationary part and a noisy stationary part. An RLS filter is then used to filter the noise from the stationary signal. Our new method is experimentally compared with various noise filtering approaches from literature.},

	abstract = {Image sequence restoration has been steadily gaining importance
		with the increasing prevalence of visual digital media. Automated
			treatment of archived video material typically involves dealing with
			replacement noise in the form of "blotches" that have varying intensity
			levels and "grain" noise. In the case of replacement noise, the problem
			is essentially one of missing data that must be detected and then
			reconstructed based on surrounding spatio-temporal information, whereas
			the additive noise can be treated as a noise-reduction problem. It is
			typical to treat these problems as separate issues; however, it is clear
			that the presence of noise has an effect on the ability to detect
			missing data and vice versa. This paper therefore introduces a fully
			Bayesian specification for the problem that allows an algorithm to be
			designed that acknowledges and exploits the influences from each of the
			subprocesses, causing the observed degradation. Markov chain Monte Carlo
			(MCMC) methodology is applied to the joint detection and removal of both
			replacement and additive noise components. It can be seen that many of
			the previous processes presented for noise reduction and missing data
			treatment are special cases of the framework presented here},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the removal of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) from a given image sequence. By extending a frame in the spatial and temporal dimensions, the sequence is transformed into the volumetric data in which each frame includes both the spatial and temporal correlation. Image sequence denoising is then formulated as an optimization problem that can be iteratively solved by constructing a rank-sparsity representation on a propagated dictionary. The proposed algorithm effectively trains this dictionary by adaptively determining the required number of iterations. Restoration of the volumetric data is adaptively determined in terms of the noise level. The results on some standard data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm and the sparse K-SVD algorithm. If a sequence is characterized by global motion (the moving objects in a scene with similar trajectories, i.e., they moves as a unit) or high motion activity, the performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of block-matching and 4-D filtering (BM4D) and video block-matching and 4-D filtering (V-BM4D).},

To take full advantage of the strong spatio-temporal correlations of neighboring frames, a global motion compensation followed by a selective block-matching is first applied to adjacent frames, which increases their temporal correlations without distorting the interframe noise statistics. Then, a multiframe interscale wavelet thresholding is performed to denoise the current central frame. The simulations we made on standard grayscale video sequences for various noise levels demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution in reducing additive white Gaussian noise. Obtained at a lighter computational load, our results are even competitive with most state-of-the-art redundant wavelet-based techniques.

AWGN is being considered which behaves as Gaussian random variable. In this paper, spatial filtering of individual frames is done in the wavelet domain, and the filtering between the frames is done by recursive temporal filter. Spatial filtering is done by taking wavelet transform of individual frames and then modifying the wavelet coefficients by spatially adaptive bayesian wavelet shrinkage method. The denoising artifacts and residual noise differ from frame to frame which produces unpleasant visual effect. Hence filtering in time domain is essential. Temporal filtering is based on a simple block based motion detector and on selective recursive time averaging of frames. This technique outperforms sequential spatio-temporal filters, 2-D spatial filters and 3-D (spatio-temporal) in terms of visual quality as well as quantitative (PSNR) performance measures.},

The shearlet representation is a multiscale pyramid of well-localized waveforms defined at various locations and orientations, which was introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional multiscale systems in dealing with multidimensional data. While the shearlet approach shares the general philosophy of curvelets and surfacelets, it is based on a very different mathematical framework, which is derived from the theory of affine systems and uses shearing matrices rather than rotations. This allows a natural transition from the continuous setting to the digital setting and a more flexible mathematical structure. The 3-D digital shearlet transform algorithm presented in this paper consists in a cascade of a multiscale decomposition and a directional filtering stage. The filters employed in this decomposition are implemented as finite-length filters, and this ensures that the transform is local and numerically efficient. To illustrate its performance, the 3-D discrete shearlet transform is applied to problems of video denoising and enhancement, and compared against other state-of-the-art multiscale techniques, including curvelets and surfacelets.},

Filtering is performed by computing the weighted average of image values within a spatiotemporal support along the estimated motion trajectory at each pixel. The weights are determined by optimizing a well defined mathematical criterion, which provides an implicit mechanism for deemphasizing the contribution of the outlier pixels within the spatiotemporal filter support to avoid blurring. The AWA filter is therefore particularly well suited for filtering sequences that contain segments with abruptly changing scene content due to, for example, rapid zooming and changes in the view of the camera. The performance of the proposed AWA filter is compared with that of the spatiotemporal, local linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) filtering. The results demonstrate that the proposed AWA filter-outperforms the LMMSE filter, especially in the cases of low signal-to-noise ratios and abruptly varying scene content},

The motion estimation helps to set short exposure and high ISO for frames with fast motion, thereby minimizing most motion blur in recorded videos. This AE function largely turns video enhancement into a denoising problem. This paper studies the problem of how to achieve high-quality video denoising in the context of motion-based exposure control. Unlike previous denoising works which either avoid using motion estimation, such as BM3D [7], or assume reliable motion estimation as input, such as [13], our method evaluates the reliability of flow at each pixel and uses that reliability as a weight to integrate spatial denoising and temporal denoising. This weighted combination scheme makes our method robust to optical flow failure over regions with repetitive texture or uniform color and combines the advantages of both spatial and temporal denoising. Our method also exploits high quality frames in a sequence to effectively enhance noisier frames. In experiments using both synthetic and real videos, our method outperforms the state of the art [7, 13].},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider denoising of image sequences that are corrupted by zero-mean additive white Gaussian noise. Relative to single image denoising techniques, denoising of sequences aims to also utilize the temporal dimension. This assists in getting both faster algorithms and better output quality. This paper focuses on utilizing sparse and redundant representations for image sequence denoising, extending the work reported in [1], [2]. In the single image setting, the K-SVD algorithm is used to train a sparsifying dictionary for the corrupted image. This paper generalizes the above algorithm by offering several exten- sions: i) the atoms used are 3-D; ii) the dictionary is propagated from one frame to the next, reducing the number of required iterations; and iii) averaging is done on patches in both spatial and temporal neighboring locations. These modifications lead to substantial benefits in complexity and denoising performance, compared to simply running the single image algorithm sequen- tially. The algorithm’s performance is experimentally compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating comparable or favorable results.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel video denoising method based on nondecimated wavelet band filtering. In the proposed method, motion estimation and adaptive recursive temporal filtering are performed in a closed loop, followed by an intra-frame spatially adaptive filter. All processing occurs in the wavelet domain. The paper introduces new wavelet-based motion reliability measures. We make a difference between motion reliability per orientation and reliability per wavelet band. These two reliability measures are employed in different stages of the proposed denoising scheme. The reliability per orientation (horizontal and vertical) measure is used in the proposed motion estimation scheme while the reliability of the estimated motion vectors (MVs) per wavelet band is utilized for subsequent adaptive temporal and spatial filtering. We propose a novel cost function for motion estimation which takes into account the spatial orientation of image structures and their motion matching values. Our motion estimation approach is a novel wavelet-domain three-step scheme, where the refinement of MVs in each step is determined based on the proposed motion reliabilities per orientation. The temporal filtering is performed separately in each wavelet band along the estimated motion trajectory and the parameters of the temporal filter depend on the motion reliabilities per wavelet band. The final spatial filtering step employs an adaptive smoothing of wavelet coefficients that yields a stronger filtering at the positions where the temporal filter was less effective. The results on various grayscale sequences demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms several state-of-the-art filters visually (as judged by a small test panel) as well as in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio},
